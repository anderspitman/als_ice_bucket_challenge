=================

This is a github page for hosting a visualization of the [ALS Ice Bucket Challenge](http://www.alsa.org/fight-als/ice-bucket-challenge.html). This visualization specifically deals with representing who challenged who in a graphical manner, so we can get a feel for part of the viral spread of the movement.

Currently all the data is kept in a flat file in data.json. It's simple to add new entries. All fields are required but can be blank except for the name. The graph uses simple text matching to link nodes, so the spelling and capitalization are very important.

I'm new to d3.js and many of the concepts involved with handling this type of data, so suggestions (or implementations) for improvement are greatly appreciated!

There's no way I can keep up with this myself. Please fork and add some entries! Submit a pull request and I'll include it. Eventually I want to make a way for anyone to edit the data live, like a wiki. Again, help with this would be awesome.
